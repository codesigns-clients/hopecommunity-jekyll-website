				<h3 class="h4">Safeguarding Children is everyone's responsibility</h3>
				
				<p>All children and young people linked with Hope Community Projects, wherever they are, whoever they are with, whatever they are doing, have the right to protection from neglect, physical, emotional and sexual abuse.</p>

				<p>All members of the public, as well as professionals, have a responsibility for the protection of children and reporting concerns about a child’s welfare or safety.</p>

				<p>Hope Community Projects ensures statutory requirements concerning Disclosure and Barring Service checks are met, maintains an up to date Safeguarding policy and procedures, and provides safeguarding training to all staff and volunteers.</p>

				<p><strong>All Hope Community Projects staff and volunteers who come into contact with the children, young people and their families will:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Be able to identify potential indicators of abuse or neglect</li>
					<li>Have read the Safeguarding Policy</li>
					<li>Know their role and responsibilities within their team</li>
					<li>Know how to communicate and record concerns</li>
					<li>Know to act upon concerns in line with the principles and procedures for local child protection management and Working Together to Safeguard Children.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Therefore, all children and young people in contact with Hope Community Projects will:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Be treated with respect and afforded full civil and legal rights</li>
					<li>Be listened to and taken seriously, whatever their level of development or communication</li>
					<li>Be given time to do things for themselves, to understand and be understood</li>
					<li>Be involved in decisions that affect them</li>
					<li>Have their privacy respected at all times and in all places</li>
					<li>Have a right to confidentiality – all information about them will be treated carefully, be kept safe and only shared with those people who need to know.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>The wellbeing of a child is the paramount consideration in all circumstances.</strong></p>
